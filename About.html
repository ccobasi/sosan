                        <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
                        <p>Oil Spillage has become the sad reality of the Delta today. From the Western end of Ondo to the Eastern end of Akwa
                        Ibom, oil spillage is a recurrent decimal. In itself, oil spillage is not the problem because it can be cleaned and it is not unique to Nigeria. The problem,
                        however, is the government's lack of interest in the plight of the poor fishermen and riverine dwellers of the Delta who
                        have to face the reality of black oil on their land and waters. The oil companies pay little to no interest to these
                        spills and even when monies are disbursed for cleanup, they end up on the stomach of the so-called Niger Delta leaders.</p>
    
                        <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
                        <p>What about the militants that claim to fight for the rights of the people by blowing up pipes (and by extension causing
                        more spillages)? Many of them have been bought off by the FG. The amount of money the FG spends to feed the ex-militants
                        in a month is enough to clean up a large section of the oil spills in Niger Delta. What are the militants doing about it
                        now that their purses are full?</p>
    
                        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
                        <p>The blame for these spills goes to each and every one of us. To the government, for its negligence and blatant disregard
                        for the welfare of its citizens who have to suffer the bitter taste of black crude, spilt over their water and land. To
                        the Niger Delta leaders who eat the little money that may be used to satiate the plights of the jobless fishermen,
                        farmers, and riverine dwellers who have nowhere to go. To the militants and agitators who use a genuine cause to enrich
                        themselves at the detriment of the people they swore to fight for. To the average Nigerian who turns away from sordid
                        images such as the ones on this thread; who rather pretend not to know what their fellow citizens are facing every day.</p>
    
                        <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
                        <p>The Niger Delta is a mistreated and wealthy bride of Nigeria. She may not know her true worth now or have good leaders
                        and agitators, but a day has come when the bride shall say enough is enough and the day has given birth to the formation
                        of SOSAN. SOSAN is here to remedy what the evil leaders and the oil companies have done against a once arable and
                        ecologically rich region. We alone have to break free of the chains we have allowed ourselves to be entrapped in.
                        I am Ani Chidinma Esther, an organic chemist. The plight of my people in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria inspired this
                        movement and it is my course to bring sanity to this region through this platform.
                        As an organic chemist, you have a valuable skill set that can contribute significantly to your community's development
                        under the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here are some ideas:</p>
    
                        <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
                        <p>Who we are
                        Sagbama Oil Spill Advocay Network (SOSAN) is a community development network working in the Niger Delta, Nigeria.
                        SOSAN is an NGO that provides assistance to oil-spill clean-up, we don't ask for payment or contracts from the
                        government, rather we are providing training for the local people, and technology that is good for the environment, i.e.
                        that is not further polluting. We have demonstrated this in one of our community training programmes and people were
                        convinced that with many organizations like ours in the Niger Delta, their problem will be reduced to minimal. We bring
                        not-for-profit help that is very innovative, and this is something that you rarely see in Africa.
                        Our office is based Sagbama, Nigeria, and is assisted by a small team in London, UK. We were established in 2014.
                        What we do
                        SOSAN works with communities in the Niger Delta impacted by the oil and gas industry, weak governance, insecurity, a
                        lack of jobs and wider environmental and climate challenges. We work with communities, government, civil society and the
                        private sector to identify and implement solutions to these challenges, which promote sustainable development and the
                        protection of human rights—including the right to a healthy environment. Guided by principles of participation,
                        inclusion and non-discrimination, SDN promotes the perspectives and experiences of those living in the Niger Delta at
                        the centre of all of our work, and encourages transparency and accountability between all actors in the region.<br>
                        <strong>Where we work</strong><br>
                        Our work focuses on the Niger Delta, particularly the creeks responsible for the highest levels of oil and gas
                        production: Sagbama and its environment.<br>
                        <strong>Resultant Effect</strong><br>
                        <strong>Lack of livelihood options:</strong><br>
                        The oil and gas industry has dominated the regional economy and stifled the development of other sectors. The revenues
                        it generates have reduced the incentive for government and businesses to invest in the wider economy. This also means
                        young people are more likely to enter dangerous livelihoods such as oil theft and criminal gangs, which are widespread
                        across the Niger Delta.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Widespread pollution and climate impacts:</strong><br>
                        The Niger Delta is one of the most polluted environments on Earth and a key front in tackling climate change and
                        ensuring a just transition. Millions of barrels of oil have been spilled over decades and research estimates 11,000
                        infants die prematurely as a result of oil spill pollution each year. Huge quantities of natural gas are wasted through
                        flaring each year—in 2022, flared gas had the potential to generate about the same amount of energy as Nigeria’s annual
                        electricity consumption, and this emmitted 12 millions tonnes of CO2. The region is also home to Africa’s largest
                        mangrove forest, which is a huge carbon sink, and must be protected. <br>
                        <strong>Conflict:</strong><br>
                        The Niger Delta has experienced waves of militant conflict since the 1990s as groups vent grievances and vie for control
                        of oil and gas revenues. With a very high number of illicit small arms and light weapons reportedly in circulation in
                        Nigeria, everyday violence is common, including criminal, intra-communal, and other conflicts. 1/20 households
                        experienced a bereavement due to conflict between 2010 and 2017. <br>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <strong>Our Focus</strong><br>
                        
                        <strong>Protecting the environment and addressing climate impacts</strong><br>
                        We aim to reduce the negative environmental impact of the oil and gas sector, support climate adaptation and mitigation,
                        and ensure a just transition to a green economy. Our work includes documenting the extent of pollution and climate
                        emissions; working with environmental regulators to support oil spill clean-up; supporting communities to address
                        climate impacts, for example, through climate smart agriculture and biodiversity protection; and supporting the National
                        Assembly to improve environmental legislation. <br>
                        <strong>Fostering sustainable livelihoods</strong><br>
                        We strive to demonstrate the potential of economic opportunities outside
                        of the oil and gas sector, and support vulnerable young people who are
                        making a living in risky ways to enter safe, dignified work. We work in
                        some of the most difficult locations in the Niger Delta, running livelihoods
                        projects to demonstrate their potential to communities, development
                        donors, the government, and the private sector. <br>
                        
                        
                        <strong>Supporting peace and security</strong><br>
                        We advocate to persuade the government and oil and gas
                        companies to listen to the concerns of those living in the Niger
                        Delta, and to deliver long-term development interventions. Our
                        work includes supporting dialogue and mediation between local
                        communities, engaging in policy work with the government, and
                        working with at-risk groups to reduce local conflicts, such as
                        those arising from negligence from the government. <br>
                        
                        <strong>SDN supports…</strong><br>
                        the efforts of those affected by the extractives industry and weak governance, and has worked in the Niger Delta since
                        2004. The Niger Delta is Africa’s largest oil-producing region but in spite of this its people have seen little benefit.
                        Instead, they have borne the brunt of decades of pollution from oil spills and gas flares, high unemployment, government
                        mismanagement, conflict, and everyday violence. <br>
                        <strong>We work with…</strong><br>
                        communities and engage with governments, companies and other stakeholders to ensure the promotion and protection of
                        human rights, including the right to a healthy environment. Our projects aim to promote good governance, protect the
                        environment, create sustainable livelihoods, and support peace and security. <br>
                        <strong>We do this through…</strong><br>
                        delivering independent research and analysis, and increasing access to information to promote transparency and inform
                        debate about the actions of government and the oil and gas industry in the Niger Delta; through campaigning and support
                        to communities to engage with government and the oil and gas sector to influence their actions; and through working with
                        government and civil society to support them to fulfil their roles in regulating and scrutinising the industry. <br>

                        Documenting and improving the response to oil spill pollution
                        In 2015, SOSAN developed the Oil Spill Monitor, an online tool used by the National Oil Spill Detection and Response
                        Agency (NOSDRA, a government regulator) to record and manage the response to oil spills, and make this information
                        public. In 2019 we updated the Oil Spill Monitor to improve its functionality to become the central tool used to record
                        and respond to oil spills.
                        
                        Having oil spill records published publicly… has improved transparency in the oil and gas industry. The platform has
                        also increased the pace with which decisions are taken by providing readily accessible data for officers to query anytime, anywhere. - Mohammed Gumsuri, Senior Environmental Scientist, NOSDRA
                        
                        The Oil Spill Monitor has been used by academics, civil society organisations, and the public to understand the impact
                        of oil spills in the Niger Delta—one study shows that children are twice as likely to die in their first month of life
                        if their mother lived near an oil spill before conception. Before the Oil Spill Monitor, it was difficult for the public
                        to access information on oil spills. Now this data is available, it has improved the relationship between NOSDRA and
                        communities, who were previously sceptical about its work; improving transparency, and ensuring an effective response to
                        oil spills.
                        
                        The creation of the oil spill monitor has enhanced transparency and hence, synergy and trust between government and host
                        communities. - NOSDRA staff member
                        
                        
                        <br><strong>Promoting good governanace</strong><br>
                        Supporting communities to hold government to account
                        SOSAN’s Community Assessment Group (CAG) approach works with communities to collectively define their development
                        priorities, access government budgets and plans—where available—and to engage with government agencies to highlight
                        their concerns and demands, holding them to account on what they have committed to deliver.
                        In just six communities between 2016-2020, the CAGs helped secure over USD $12m of projects in their communities, from
                        the construction of road, drainage, and bridge infrastructure, to renovations and equipment of schools, benefitting more
                        than 250,000 people. Since 2020, this work has been expanded to 46 communities, where 24 CAGs have been set up. The
                        approach has also been elevated to the State level, where key priorities have been developed which will benefit the
                        entire State.
                        For example, in Ologbiri community in Bayelsa State, the Community Secondary School building had been unfit for use
                        since 2015; the roof was leaking and collapsed, and its doors and windows were broken. With SOSAN’s support, Ologbiri
                        CMG persistently engaged with local government and relevant ministries until they were successful in getting the school
                        building renovated. It is now functional again, sending a powerful message to both the Ologbiri community and
                        government. <br>
                        
                        <strong>Supporting Peace and Security</strong><br>
                        Supporting dialogue between government and ex-agitators, and promoting long-term development
                        After a sharp increase in militant activities and the bombing of oil pipelines in 2016, SOSAN, alongside others,
                        promoted and supported dialogue between the Federal Government and ex-agitators.
                        This resulted in the Strategic Implementation Work Plan, an initiative of the Office of the Vice President and the
                        Inter-Ministerial Working Group on the Niger Delta, to establish a coordinated plan for long-term peace and development.
                        SOSAN worked with government ministries to produce this plan, and we were the only network with observer status in the
                        Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Niger Delta. SOSAN continued this high-level collaboration, working with the Ministry
                        of Niger Delta Affairs, to set up a public online portal to increase the visibility of development projects in the Niger
                        Delta and the status of their progress. SOSAN also worked with representatives from the Niger Delta region, such as the
                        Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) to improve how they consult and communicate with communities across the region and
                        represent their interests to the Federal Government.
                        SOSAN’s trusted, independent position, and our local presence, means we are often relied upon to bring different groups
                        together and find solutions.
